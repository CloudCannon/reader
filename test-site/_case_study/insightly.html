      Web developer Heather White would probably agree with the adage that one
      change leads to another. In early 2018 she started a new job with CRM
      vendor Insightly and then, within weeks, found herself transitioning the
      company’s sites to Jekyll and CloudCannon.


      White joined a small team that was short on technical skills and she
      personally had no prior experience with static sites. Despite starting
      from scratch with Jekyll-compatible content management systems, she got
      stuck into the project and within six months had Insightly’s web presence
      running smoothly on CloudCannon.&nbsp;


      Looking back, she says she’s stoked with the switch and credits
      CloudCannon’s inherent simplicity and responsive customer support for much
      of what has proven to be a successful transition.

      Not only do we have great support but everything I need to manage the
      website is in one place, it’s really straightforward and I have pretty
      much complete control over everything that happens in and around the site.

    heading: A long history of outages
    content_markdown: >-
      San Francisco-based Insightly’s WordPress sites had a long history of
      outages, many due to a plethora of plugins that weren’t updating. At its
      worst, the company’s main marketing site was going offline every few
      weeks. The company’s CEO got fed up, mandated a move to Jekyll, and asked
      White, his incoming front-end developer, to make it happen.


      Knowing that the right interface for non-technical content editors would
      be critical, White set about shortlisting CMS. She trialed a number of
      options, including building a test site with Netlify and React, and
      finally opted for the simplicity and control offered by CloudCannon.

      Drawing on Jekyll and CloudCannon documentation, White built the new site
      from the ground up. An early decision was for in-depth interfaces using
      data collections. “They are data objects of tons of our content – blog
      posts, customer stories, webinars, e-books and so on,” she explains. “I
      created data files that live on the website that can then be pulled in
      from other web environments on CloudCannon to inform CloudCannon’s
      interface. They let people pick blog posts and other content and then
      display them either on internal websites or on websites that we use for
      account-based marketing.”


      The deeper she got into editing, the more White liked her new CMS. “The
      way it allows you to edit the interface is really cool,” she says, and
      points to other advantages.&nbsp; “I love having my domains all in one
      place because I can easily take action on errors. Plus the learning curve
      for editors is relatively small because CloudCannon works in a similar
      fashion to advanced custom fields in WordPress.”

    heading: Quality control
    content_markdown: >-
      Another win: control. White, who values quality control and was keen to
      limit the opportunities for errors on her sites, could hide fields, offer
      tool tips on fields, and use clear settings to limit options for a content
      creator or content manager. “That was a big win,” she says.


      White tapped CloudCannon’s support team throughout the build. “They were
      always respectful, always super helpful,” she recounts. “CloudCannon’s
      support in that transition was such a lifeline.”

      In early October 2018 Insightly took its new sites live. Their stability
      since then has been exceptional, White reports. “With the exception of
      maybe two blips when Cloudflare went down, which of course means everybody
      has gone down, our sites have never failed since we switched. Not once.”


      White’s summary of the transition? “I’m stoked that we’re on CloudCannon.
      Stoked that not only do we have great support but everything I need to
      manage the website is in one place, it’s really straightforward and I have
      pretty much complete control over everything that happens in and around
      the site without having to dig too deeply into any unknown black boxes
      like stuck servers, for example. From a development point of view, I’m
      glad we made the switch.”
