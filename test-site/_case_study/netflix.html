      You’ll know Netflix as the world's largest streaming entertainment service
      with over 204 million customers in more than 190 countries and a market
      cap of $234 billion. What isn’t immediately obvious, however, is the
      extensive network of microsites the company relies on to maintain and
      manage relationships with its customers and partners.


      Those sites have been a headache for Netflix’s marketing team. Based on a
      range of content management systems (CMS) including WordPress, Drupal and
      Google Sites, they were time-consuming and expensive to create and
      cumbersome to maintain. Inconsistencies in branding were becoming apparent
      and some sites were going stale because the expertise required by each of
      the CMS platforms was siloed.


      It was time for a better solution.

    heading: 'The answer: Jekyll and CloudCannon'
    content_markdown: >-
      In late 2014, Netflix went looking for a solution that would allow the
      quick roll-out of highly customizable microsites. It selected Jekyll, a
      static site generator that was fast, didn’t require constant security
      updates, was simple enough for new developers to easily get up to speed
      and would readily scale to even a Netflix-sized audience.&nbsp;


      The next step was a way to host and manage content on the new Jekyll
      sites.


      The answer: CloudCannon. It was recommended by a new employee who had used
      CloudCannon as a freelancer. Netflix initially trialled it on a single
      project, [devices.netflix.com](https://devices.netflix.com/en/), which
      lists and recommends the vast range of Netflix-supported devices available
      to consumers.

    heading: 'Fuss-free content changes, easy syncing and low overheads'
    content_markdown: >-
      CloudCannon’s merits quickly became obvious. It lets developers work
      rapidly and frees them from the overhead of maintaining servers and
      updates. It gives content editors a staging environment that allows
      fuss-free content changes and gets everyone pulling in the same direction
      by syncing through Git.&nbsp;


      A further benefit is the integration of Netflix's internal translation
      system into CloudCannon, which allows for the seamless translation of
      Netflix sites into more than 30 languages.


      Netflix has steadily moved more of its microsites across to CloudCannon.
      In 2017 the effort stepped up with CloudCannon’s adoption by the Product
      Creative team, whose sites offer the welter of documentation that
      maintains relationships with Netflix’s creative agency partners.

      Today, 20 Netflix microsites and 80 editors are supported by CloudCannon.
      Among them are [openconnect](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en_gb/),
      which supports ISP partners, and a site promoting [No Rules
      Rules](https://www.norulesrules.com/), the book by Netflix co-founder Reed
      Hastings that explains the company’s unconventional culture.


      As Netflix continues to adopt CloudCannon for microsites, the objective
      remains clear: a single, flexible platform that can handle all use cases
      and doesn’t grind system admins into the ground.
    quote: >-
      At Netflix, we cater to audiences all over the world. We need a CMS
      platform that can translate our microsites to the 30+ languages Netflix
      supports. CloudCannon integrates with our internal translation workflows
      and makes the entire process seamless.
