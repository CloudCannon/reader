    content_markdown: >-
      A veterinarian by profession, owner and developer Viv Barakat has a love
      for continuous learning and experimenting. After starting with hand-coded
      HTML, Viv moved to juggling half veterinarian and half web development and
      eventually to fully sustaining a web development career. With 10 years of
      web experience, Viv communicates with local businesses and communities to
      convey their vision to their audience by creating clean, beautiful
      websites.

    heading: 'An easy, full-ownership CMS transition'
    alignment: right
    content_markdown: >-
      Having been in the industry for so long, Viv has gone through multiple
      changes in software. His journey started with .NET, Silverstripe, and
      Webpop, before moving to hosting on CloudCannon after learning about
      modern static sites. Having done a bit of research himself, he quickly got
      stuck in and found a static site generator which best suited his needs.
      Thereafter, having found CloudCannon to tick almost all his boxes, the
      rest was history. A straightforward setup and interface helps both him and
      his clients save time, who can now go in and easily edit the site
      themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    quote: >-
      I can pull a site down on and run it on Jekyll on my local machine and it
      is a relatively straightforward process. For me that’s magic. I really
      like the fact that I have that control.

    heading: Support that understands Lumina’s needs
    content_markdown: >-
      Establishing the right support relationship with an organization without
      feeling like a nuisance or another face in the crowd can sometimes be
      difficult. Having access to a responsive support team has given Viv the
      confidence to ask just about anything and feel understood.&nbsp;


      In addition, Viv’s relationship with support has led to requests and
      suggestions for features on the platform and projects, which have
      ultimately been implemented alongside other general platform features that
      have benefited Lumina’s work.

      needs. While he works on his passion, CloudCannon’s support team will be
      there to answer all his questions and needs.
    quote: >-
      It’s been really good because everybody has been proactive at getting back
      to me, and usually the problems are sorted out very quickly. I’ve even had
      a few feature requests that they’ve ended up applying and letting me know
      they’ve done this.
