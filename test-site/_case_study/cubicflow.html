      As a team, Dan and Matt, the founders of Cubicflow, go all the way back.
      Starting as teenagers meeting online in graphic design forums, they
      progressed from smaller to incrementally larger projects together, which
      influenced their personal and professional interests in design and
      development. After beginning tech careers and gaining considerable
      experience, including working in the ranks of big tech, their paths
      eventually led them to found their own design agency - Cubicflow.
    quote: >-
      There is no transparency in WordPress' plugins, and you are so dependent
      on them. When looking at the codebase, I would often ask, where is some of
      this coming from?

      Cubicflow is much more than simply websites. Their extensive experience
      and love of impactful design have made them experts who can own and advise
      on every stage of modern development, from start to finish and anywhere in
      between. Here is just some of what is offered by the team:

    heading: Frustration with legacy CMS setups
    alignment: right
    content_markdown: >-
      As with many origin stories, Cubicflow started out with WordPress for
      marketing websites. However, it wasn't long until the drawbacks of the
      system began to show. WordPress is known to offer vast options, but
      interactions in the system were often unpredictable. Updates, often
      automatic or potentially initiated by clients, could cause plugin clashes
      and downtime, leading to wasted, frustrating admin time finding the source
      of the problem, and understanding how exactly the plugins work.

      We needed to figure out a way for our clients to work with static sites -
      we couldn't expect them to learn Markdown and other tools

    heading: Customization is key for designers
    content_markdown: >-
      In addition, as design professionals, the team also found many of the
      templates unpalatable and laborious to change. Not only that, they desired
      different hosting options and simply having a local development
      environment to make changes and experimentation easier. Unfortunately,
      these were restricted by the complicated setup and over-reliance on
      plugins. This ever-increasing set of problems led Cubicflow to seek a
      solution that would give them more control from the ground up.


      Investigation of alternatives soon led to discovering static site
      generation and Jekyll. Jekyll's simplicity made customization of designs
      easier, more powerful, and extremely portable. No database or complicated
      setup to worry about. However, while Cubicflow now had a tool for greater
      customization, static sites by themselves were only part of the solution.

    heading: Removing roadblocks with CloudCannon and static sites
    content_markdown: >-
      For static sites to be the alternative to WordPress that they wanted,
      Cubicflow needed to find hosted infrastructure to automate their needs and
      allow editing, without clients needing to learn new tools. After testing
      multiple options, Cubicflow was immediately convinced by CloudCannon's
      easy setup and powerful interface for editing and sharing, as well as low
      maintenance needs.


      With CloudCannon, Cubicflow was now able to launch powerful static
      websites live and quickly share visual editing with clients, while also
      allowing them to develop locally and easily manage content through Git
      syncing. The only issue remaining to solve was creating e-commerce
      solutions, which meant having to straddle two different systems. However,
      Snipcart soon came to solve the e-commerce game, and the team was finally
      able to move forward on one platform for everything.

    heading: More time for experimentation
    content_markdown: >-
      With static sites and CloudCannon as the spark, Cubicflow joined the
      static site movement, free to design and work as they needed without
      complicated infrastructure and convoluted plugins slowing them down.


      The world of Jamstack is also a fast-moving community working hard to
      implement the bleeding edge of technologies for fast, stable and scalable
      websites. Since working with Jekyll, Cubicflow have discovered a whole
      variety of other options to experiment with and increase their repertoire,
      rather than being confined to one limited ecosystem.

      Cubicflow is flourishing in the world of static sites and loves using
      CloudCannon for its CMS. Naturally, CloudCannon will be there to help them
      in their further journeys.
