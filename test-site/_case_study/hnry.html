      Reimaging what professional life looks like with a modern definition, Hnry
      helps creators focus on their craft by lifting the weight and anxieties of
      managing their finances. Hnry streamlines the hand-off process, making it
      simple and affordable.


      What started off as a passion project to ease tax and invoicing management
      for freelancers and contractors quickly turned into NZ’s largest
      specialist accountant for the self-employed. With their ever-expanding
      team of bright and hardworking people, Hnry has reached many milestones
      within a period of only 3 years. They notably scooped up two Wellington
      Gold Awards, featured in the NZBusiness Magazine and are now growing
      quickly in the Australian market.

    heading: Standard CMS solutions are often a strain on developers
    content_markdown: >-
      Having previously used WordPress and relying on developers to make even
      the most incremental of changes, Hnry was more than ready to make a switch
      to something better fitting their needs. However, a content management
      system (CMS) that aligned with Hnry’s needs and matched their values would
      need considerable flexibility and efficiency.


      A suitable solution would enable content editors to make multiple,
      concurrent updates through real-time visual editing, while also providing
      continuous deployment and not impeding developers. Additionally, it would
      help team members to delegate responsibility efficiently, with different
      complexity levels for different levels of technical ability.

    heading: 'Fast, effective workflows that support the whole team'
    alignment: right
    content_markdown: >-
      This is where Hnry and CloudCannon’s great partnership began. As a
      recommendation from a trusted friend, James took on CloudCannon as the
      platform to create, host, and manage the [Hnry website](https://hnry.co){:
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The team onboarded quickly and
      immediately became accustomed to the system, positively changing their
      workflow and allowing the flexibility for any team member to contribute to
      the site.&nbsp;


      No longer restricted by the constrained nature of out-of-the-box sites,
      they were able to take advantage of all the benefits of great performance,
      fast deployment, and improved developer experience that comes with static
      sites.

      With CloudCannon it has just been really easy for us and has actually made
      it far more efficient for us as a business to react to demand in the
      market.
