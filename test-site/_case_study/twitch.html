      Sam Harnack, Technical Marketing Director for San Francisco-based live
      streaming service Twitch, had a problem.&nbsp;


      Twitch’s marketing team relied on a slate of microsites to publish
      everything from developer documentation and advertising info to conference
      details, learning resources and brand guidelines. Built on Ruby on Rails,
      the sites made nobody happy. Developers found them cumbersome to build and
      magnets for support tickets, while the marketers bemoaned the lack of a
      preview or staging environment and the frequent failures of live sites
      that inevitably followed.


      Early in 2017 Harnack, a recent arrival to Twitch, went looking for a
      better way. The first step was switching to the Jekyll static site
      generator, which was fast, secure and could easily scale to Twitch’s
      fast-growing global audience. Next, a new CMS.

      while allowing developers to use the tools and workflows they know.

    heading: What Twitch needed
    content_markdown: >-
      The requirements were demanding. It would need to stand up sites quickly,
      sharply reduce support requests, offer faultless performance under load,
      and support hosting on Amazon AWS infrastructure. The marketing team had
      its own shopping list: It needed a CMS it could use with a minimum of
      technical know-how and without recourse to developers, and would provide
      seamless translation into 27 languages.


      Twitch trialled numerous headless CMS but found in each case that they
      were too complex in use and that content was disconnected from the live
      site.

      The breakthrough came when CloudCannon was put through its paces. It
      quickly matched the specification, allowing editors to write directly
      inline and to publish without the assistance of a developer. Importantly,
      it integrated with Twitch’s translation workflow to automate the
      translation process, letting marketers generate content in English and
      then export to human translators via Smartling. The result: frictionless
      creation of multiple language versions of Twitch’s marketing sites.

      Harnack first transitioned Twitch’s legal pages to CloudCannon and then
      made it the default for all the company’s microsites. “CloudCannon
      provides a quality editing interface for our marketing team,” he explains,
      “while allowing developers to use the tools and workflows they
      know.”&nbsp;


      Twitch’s CloudCannon-based sites today serve a streaming platform that
      supports 2.2 million content creators and attracts 26.5 million daily
      active users, making it easily the world’s number one in its
      category.&nbsp;

      CloudCannon is the perfect mix - editors find it easy to update content
      inline and their content is saved back to our Git repository, so we never
      felt locked in.
