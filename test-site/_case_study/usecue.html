      Technical excellence, beautiful design, integrity. All of these are
      important for Joost van der Schee, owner and operator of [Usecue
      B.V.](https://www.usecue.com/), to deliver amazing web solutions to
      clients, who can rest assured that speed and quality are a focus and not
      based on false promises.
    quote: >-
      Time is really expensive. With WordPress I was spending a lot of time
      reviewing and managing plugins. Switching to CloudCannon has meant I no
      longer need to spend as much time managing my clients' sites and can focus
      on development.

    heading: Increasing demands require greater adaptation
    content_markdown: >-
      A product design engineer by trade, Joost has, over the years, moved from
      mainly frontend development to almost anything web-related - code,
      infrastructure, design, and more. Joost relishes the opportunity to learn
      new ideas and use new tools, and is always looking for solutions that work
      for both him and his clients.


      After experimenting with potential solutions and even a custom-made CMS,
      WordPress eventually filled the gap due to how easy it is to set up and
      manage a single site. But with increasing demand, changes, and management
      needs, the cracks in an aging ecosystem slowly made it apparent that it is
      less than optimal for his flourishing business's needs.

    heading: 'Legacy issues: security, maintenance, and high costs'
    content_markdown: >-
      Being a freelancer means you have a hard limit to your capacities, but
      what you have created - and potentially need to manage - is constantly
      growing. With dozens of different WordPress setups for clients, much of
      Joost’s work was necessarily being offloaded to hosting environments,
      which made management difficult and sometimes led to security issues.


      Not wanting to deal with the headaches of constant maintenance, security,
      and any potential legal issues, Joost sought out a better management
      solution for servers, backups, and dashboards. However, the first solution
      he found, although giving peace of mind, came at a much higher price,
      making for a hard sell for customers and extra costs to absorb.

    heading: 'A potential solution, with adoption hurdles'
    alignment: left
    content_markdown: >-
      Joost has his finger on the pulse of the latest developments in tech
      through blogs, feeds, and YouTube. Through this, he discovered Jekyll and
      static sites as a potential way to make websites faster and their
      management easier. Being a developer, Joost was immediately convinced, but
      Jekyll's lack of a CMS and competing with household names such as
      WordPress led to heavy skepticism from colleagues, as well as concerns
      around allowing collaboration with less tech-savvy people.
    quote: >-
      I'm a developer. With CloudCannon, I do what I do best - develop - and
      then offload it to whoever wants to use it, without needing to look at it
      anymore.

    heading: An all-in-one solution for modern static sites
    content_markdown: >-
      However, during this time, Joost discovered CloudCannon as a way to host
      and manage Jekyll sites, all under one roof, rather than through different
      login portals. With the ability to view created sites and monitor them -
      increasingly less - through a visual editor, management became easier and
      sites less fragile due to their architecture.


      The transition from WordPress to hosted Jekyll sites was also simple,
      without the extra overhead of plugins. Previously, Joost's WordPress sites
      had also required various add-ons, such as for custom creating entities.
      However, Jekyll's collection system - combined with CloudCannon's tight
      integration of Jekyll conventions - made the process much easier.

    content_markdown: >-
      An important result of Joost's new workflow with CloudCannon was the
      change in focus and greater control over content. Having sites consisting
      of only frontend static content made development of extremely fast, secure
      sites much simpler for Joost, as well as a fun learning experience. And
      with CloudCannon’s easy way to share content for editing with clients,
      Joost was able to focus even more on being a developer, and less on being
      a site manager.


      Now, when working with CloudCannon, Joost can create a site according to
      design with simple password authentication to hand to marketers and
      clients. And simple and customizable editing options mean that he can add
      placeholder text to functional websites, which marketers and clients can
      fill out, without him needing to be involved at all.
    quote: >-
      I think one thing was the risk of being responsible for all these minor
      issues, which I wanted to offload, but which cost me a lot of money. And
      then I found CloudCannon, and it fit the problem.

      While Joost grows his business further, for his marketing sites,
      CloudCannon will be there to help him make the process easier, giving him
      more time to focus on doing the work he loves.
