      Ocupop is a small creative agency who takes huge pride in their work. They
      call themselves "a small super-powered creative agency with zero awards",
      which is intentionally inaccurate. In reality, they've got plenty of
      accolades to throw around, and have grown a lot in recent years. But they
      aren't fixated on rapid growth or growth metrics. Instead, they thrive on
      being a small group of designers and developers with extensive experience,
      doing extraordinary work.
    quote: >-
      We love supporting CloudCannon growth because the platform is so much
      better for our clients than any other tool.

      Ocupop might be a small organization, but they've worked with, and
      continue to work with, companies and situations of all size. From
      designing pixel-perfect sites for artisanal products to every detail of
      big-tech conferences, they have huge range. Oh, and ever seen the HTML 5
      icon? That's Ocupop's work. You don't need to be a massive corporation to
      leave a big impression.

    heading: Old problems from old solutions
    content_markdown: >-
      Having been around and working with the web since the early days, Ocupop
      have been through different technologies as the industry evolves.
      Naturally, WordPress was part of the equation for a number of their
      clients, due to its presence on the market and ease of installing. As a
      result, the company needed to have PHP developers on staff to help with
      managing these projects.


      But the time and effort involved in managing WordPress sites was causing
      unnecessary headaches. Content often needed to be managed through separate
      admin portals, draining development time and resources, and the security
      of sites was always a lingering, potential concern. Ultimately, it just
      wasn't the right fit.

    heading: Finding the best tools for the team
    alignment: left
    content_markdown: >-
      In their interactions with clients, Ocupop had also learned another
      important fact: the majority didn't actually care about the tech stack
      that was being used, as long as they had a working solution. With this in
      mind, Ocupop wanted to experiment with other tools and instead make the
      choice for clients that would benefit the team.


      At the time, static site generators such as Jekyll were just entering the
      scene, and Ocupop was interested in testing out a new experience. But for
      static sites to be a real solution, they needed to find hosting and
      editing options so that both the team and clients could work on projects
      effectively, without unnecessary admin and security issues. In their quest
      for the right solution for static sites, Ocupop tested a few options, but
      found some too restricting for development.

      we're proud of our professional relationships.

    heading: Full control of design and development flow with CloudCannon
    alignment: right
    content_markdown: >-
      CloudCannon came up as a suggestion in documentation and links to trusted
      hosting providers. After trying the platform out, the value was
      immediately clear to the team, with easy management, visual editing, and
      sharing, which gave clients autonomy and didn't just render them another
      account to manage and take note of. Increasingly, this meant that Ocupop
      could have full control over their design and development cycle, and they
      soon began to put together their own flows and designs to speed up future
      work.


      Today with CloudCannon, when working on a new project, the Ocupop team can
      simply pull from a library of their own custom templates, locally build
      the sites, and then iterate on design and development with greater
      agility. When they are happy with the result, it's simply a matter of
      using CloudCannon to hand off to clients, who can take control of their
      own content. With this flow, Ocupop focuses on what they do best - design
      and development - and controls how much time they spend with clients.
    quote: >-
      CloudCannon really helps us work better. It feels nice to commit clients
      to the platform, and they feel comfortable with it.

    content_markdown: >-
      It's all about managing the client's expectations. For managing content
      and keeping to their own effective workflow, Ocupop has found their
      comfort zone with CloudCannon as their all-in-one platform. Looking to the
      future, Ocupop is always interested in new features and options being
      implemented, and CloudCannon loves having the agency on board to support.
