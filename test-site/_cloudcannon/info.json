Unfortunately, these were restricted by the complicated setup and over-reliance on plugins. This ever-increasing set of problems led Cubicflow to seek a solution that would give them more control from the ground up.\n\nInvestigation of alternatives soon led to discovering static site generation and Jekyll. Jekyll's simplicity made customization of designs easier, more powerful, and extremely portable. No database or complicated setup to worry about. However, while Cubicflow now had a tool for greater customization, static sites by themselves were only part of the solution.",

After testing multiple options, Cubicflow was immediately convinced by CloudCannon's easy setup and powerful interface for editing and sharing, as well as low maintenance needs.\n\nWith CloudCannon, Cubicflow was now able to launch powerful static websites live and quickly share visual editing with clients, while also allowing them to develop locally and easily manage content through Git syncing. The only issue remaining to solve was creating e-commerce solutions, which meant having to straddle two different systems. However, Snipcart soon came to solve the e-commerce game, and the team was finally able to move forward on one platform for everything.",

They let people pick blog posts and other content and then display them either on internal websites or on websites that we use for account-based marketing.”\n\nThe deeper she got into editing, the more White liked her new CMS. “The way it allows you to edit the interface is really cool,” she says, and points to other advantages.&nbsp; “I love having my domains all in one place because I can easily take action on errors. Plus the learning curve for editors is relatively small because CloudCannon works in a similar fashion to advanced custom fields in WordPress.”",

Based on a range of content management systems (CMS) including WordPress, Drupal and Google Sites, they were time-consuming and expensive to create and cumbersome to maintain.

Increasingly, this meant that Ocupop could have full control over their design and development cycle, and they soon began to put together their own flows and designs to speed up future work.\n\nToday with CloudCannon, when working on a new project, the Ocupop team can simply pull from a library of their own custom templates, locally build the sites, and then iterate on design and development with greater agility.

Built on Ruby on Rails, the sites made nobody happy. Developers found them cumbersome to build and magnets for support tickets, while the marketers bemoaned the lack of a preview or staging environment and the frequent failures of live sites that inevitably followed.\n\nEarly in 2017 Harnack, a recent arrival to Twitch, went looking for a better way. The first step was switching to the Jekyll static site generator, which was fast, secure and could easily scale to Twitch’s fast-growing global audience. Next, a new CMS.",
